TF-IDF vs. Word2Vec: Comparing Text Processing Techniques

1-Take the Pdf of a book called "Life3.0" by Max Tagmark. Preprocess it, use whitespace tokeniser to generate tokens. Use TF-IDF for vectorisation and plot them using t-SNE. 

2-Take the same book use bytepair encoding and then feed the tokens to word2vec for vectorisation. Plot them using t-SNE. 

3-Compare both experiments in each step (tokenisation, vectorisation, and visualisations) and deduce why one is better than the other.
